== Preface

Imagine you, in your childhood, full of dreams. You study,
learn many things, reads good books, you are one of the best students in his
class. You do this because you have a dream, and you are willing to do your best for
it. Then, the time comes for you to face the job market, to find the job of your dreams. But the dreamed opportunity seems more distant than you thought. You find your job, but you realize that it looks more like hell than a dream job. And in a short time, you start to believe that the career or the life of your dreams do not exist. That, the hard reality is that, the people spend their lives doing things they do not like, living a life without purpose and dreaming about the day of their retirement.
But there are some principles which can help people realize their dreams, and these principles can be learned and practiced.
Those same principles turned my impossible dreams into reality.
Follow me in this story, and you will understand how I applied these principles in my life.
As I said, I was a dedicated student, until the day that I came out to face the labor market.
After not finding the opportunities for my dream job, I found myself working in the fields, in the fields of sugarcane, among strange people, where there was no growth, nothing to learn and nobody to inspire me. And to make it worse, many people started making fun of me and made jokes, when I told them, I wanted to work with technology.
That made me very sad and hopeless. I started to see my dream dying and it seemed to me, that soon it would be buried in those sugar cane farms.
That year I did not go back to school, I had no more motivation and no energy for this because, the work left me exhausted and the people making jokes about my dreams left me depressed. I just wanted to get home, have dinner and sleep, because the next day, I had hard and ruthless work, a hell job waiting for me.
One day, after many searches and suffering, from the several books I had read, I learned to practice some principles which permitted me to take control of my life and my career, and take to wherever I wanted.
These are the principles I apply in my life, whenever I need to face obstacles or reach goals that seems impossible.

== 1. Believe:

Already in my childhood, living in very poor places, I started to believe. I learned that studying a lot would be the solution to get me out of the life of
deprivation. This was a fuel to feed my dream, and even having few support, I could be among the best students in the class.
When you believe and declare to yourself that, there is an achievable solution, in somewhere, you give a direction to your brain to work and find paths where
others did not.
To understand this, it is important to know some characteristics of our brain. It is an organ that consumes the most energy in the human body. Thus, it is programmed to save this energy, and reusing information. If you do not believe in your dream, desire or goal or if you believe it to be impossible, you are already giving the answer to your brain - if it is impossible, it will ignore possible solutions, as it already has the information needed. That's why it's crucial that you believe in the fulfillment of your dreams.
There are opportunities everywhere, but only those who believe are able to see.
When you say there is a solution, your brain comes out of the comfort zone and starts to work, and stops discarding opportunities.
Everything that moves us works through information. The neurons work by switching your heart beats receiving information from the brain. As you read a book, it becomes more intelligent by the transfer of information.
The most direct way to pass this information is through speech. You must affirm to yourself even if there is a solution around you, somewhere.
One important thing in this process is you eliminate resistance from your mind. The resistance occurs when you affirm something with your speech, but your mind denies, your thinking is the opposite. For example, you say that everything is fine, but it is full of fear and anxiety. Thus, the information most charged with emotion is the one, which is in your mind - that which contains fear and anxiety. If you experience anxiety, you are suggesting your mind that something is very difficult or impossible, and should be avoided. Avoid anxiety, fear and negative emotions, as this has an opposite effect to what you want.
When you create the habit of stating that there are solutions to everything you want, even if you do not realize it, your mind focuses on solutions when you face a difficulty. 
From now on, every time you think of your goal or dream, you will calmly, and confidently say: "I know that there is a solution somewhere, and my mind is already working to find it. " Breathe calmly and quietly. - "I am calm and grateful." Look for the sense of tranquility that you have felt at good times in your life, and maintain and cultivate pleasant memories. 
Thus, you will be convincing your mind to seek good experiences and stop focusing on the bad ones.


== 2. Take responsibility

Taking responsibility should be practiced in two aspects of your life. Take up responsibility for what you are, for what you are facing today and also assume
responsibilities in the environments in which you live.
Everywhere you live, there is something that does not work right or can be improved. Where there is a problem, there is a need for a solution. A leader, someone who takes the responsibility to resolve it. You be the person who solves the problems, and you will become a really valuable professional.
In addition, you must take the responsibility for your own life, your career and your destiny.
Why is it so difficult for us to take responsibility for resolving our problems? This is because, throughout life, we are getting used to always having someone responsible for us.
When we were born, our parents were responsible for our lives, when we grew up a little more, the school and the teachers were responsible. Now that we are
adults, we tend to think like that helpless child we were. 
Now, we are no more babies, but our mind still holds the sensations of when we were. That is the reason we have such a strong tendency to think others are responsible or guilty
of our situation. But we will only grow in life and in our career when we understand that we have grown and now we are responsible for our own destiny.
This is very important because it awakens in us the power to create solutions. Your mind has a tendency to seek comfort and security. When you pass into your mind the
information that it is responsible for its destination, it leaves the comfort zone and starts to seek and find solutions. And you have a great gain in this attitude of yours, because you will be in a position above the majority of the population, who live the instinct natural that others are responsible for them.
Here is a way for you to begin practicing this new transformative practice:
Next time you come across a problem in your life or the environment, say to yourself, "I believe, I can be the solution to this problem." And every time
that you think about the problem, say to yourself calmly and confidently: "I chose to be the solution, I want to be part of the solution. " And you will apply the principle of
belief - "I believe there is already a solution, I am in the process of finding it."
By applying these principles of believing and taking responsibility, you have attained a level above all who follow their natural instincts of protection. You are no longer a
simple viewer watching problems and complaining. By persisting in this habit,
you start to become a leader, the one who takes the initiative, who thinks of a solution instead of complaining. If you look at the history of the great leaders in the world, you will see that this principle is present in the lives of all of them.


== 3. Thought of owner

An owner, feels passion for his company, his house, his study. He wakes up early every day with a sparkle in his eyes, full of hope that he can make the company grow, even a little bit more on this day.
Even the owner of a successful small business has a passion for its creation.
He does not cling to petty little things, because he has something bigger to worry about.
Its major purpose is the survival of your company. It's making his business thrive.
When you think like the owner, you get to see things from another perspective. The
owner worries about how he will pay his staff at the end of the month more than details of what is being done.
The owner is a born leader, he is a warrior, who takes the responsibility of all.
Look at the successful business owners, good managers, successful leaders, pay attention if you notice them complaining. When someone commits a mistake,
that puts the project at risk, rather than complaining, he takes actions immediately to put things back in place.
How would you feel if you were the owner of the company you work for? Pay attention on how owners act. Imagine that the company is a startup of yours and that every day you improve it a little bit more. Imagine you do not have all the money you need, to provide all the technologies it needs. Would you dislike your company for that? Would you rather be complaining, or thinking of solutions to make the best of what you have? Thinking like an owner, you learn to do your best with what you have.
From the moment you get used to thinking like an owner, you start to see positive points in your work. You feel satisfied, because your company generates employment. You have a better understanding of why your company does not have the money to buy the resources you want. And as an owner you see opportunities that you did not see until then.
Think about that, for your job to exist, someone had to see an opportunity where no one saw.
Use that same thought for everything around you. What if you were the only one responsible for your project, the architect, the president of your country? How would you act?
You will realize things to do even today that can improve your environment.


== 4. Face your fears

Fear is a feeling that has accompanied us since our birth. But this is not a problem. We have some fears that are natural, that exist to protect us.
We were born afraid of falling, afraid of noise, of unknown things.
The fear we need to control and confront are some unnatural fears that can have been propagated to control us. Others ones are also beliefs that
popular culture brought to us, sometimes distributed through the media and social networks to gain more audience.
It is very important that we learn to control our fear, because one of the main differences between the people of great prominence in the world and the others, is the way in which they can identify and control their fears. Fear is one of the factors that most limit personal and career development. Sometimes this is so ingrained in our
culture, we do not even admit that we have some fear.
Start asking yourself why you are not acting in the direction of your dream.
You will notice that there is an internal dialogue, which tries to justify the actions you do not take.
You'll always find an excuse or someone guilty. Remove the excuses and guilty, and you will realize that there are fears blocking you.
Start questioning your fears. Maybe you will remember some case where someone tried something and failed. This becomes a justification for you to never try again.
Start asking yourself more questions - did anyone ever get what you want to try? How many concrete cases have you analyzed? What kinds of people are giving you this information? Are they the people who usually win, or people who never tried? Is there any real evidence that everyone has failed to do so?
You will realize that some statements that limit your life are often beliefs, which are spread among the people who avoid trying.
Start facing your fears by taking small steps in the direction you want to reach, doing a little of what he is afraid of every day, in a more controlled environment.
Let's look at a practical example. I had a fear, a block of public speaking, doing lecture was unthinkable to me. One day, I decided to face this fear on a smaller scale.
I created a YouTube channel and started posting videos. When I did this, I kept open to receiving criticism, I knew that he would receive them, I felt discomfort about it, but I continued to publish things that were useful to people.
I also joined a group that trained to do online presentations. I used to practice a little more in this small and controlled environment. After one year doing it consistently, came the opportunity to give a keynote. When this opportunity arose, my first reaction was to say no, but I remembered the small presentations I had already made, and that gave me the confidence to say yes. I submitted my presentation, gave my first keynote and started my public speaking career.
Start questioning your fears, do something you have fear for, small steps every day, join groups of people who are what you want to be. That is a good way to overcome your fears.
Face your fears, start asking yourself: - "Why am I not doing what I should to fulfill my dreams? "Apply here the principle of assuming the responsibility. Stop pointing guilty and make excuses. See yourself as the only one, responsible for your success, and you only have one way left. To win.


== 5. Value the communities

Some people often say that we live in an isolated, selfish world where
people only care about themselves. But if you look carefully, you will see that there are many people who have the desire to help. People want to do something useful, but sometimes, they do not know exactly how to do or how to start.
When you join a group or social network and ask for help, many people take your problem as their own. People lose nights of
sleep thinking about how to solve some problem that was posted on social networks.
There is an African proverb that says: "If you want to go faster, go alone if you want to go far, go accompanied." I add one more value here: if you walk with groups or
communities, you will go faster and further.
Let me tell an example:
When I went to São Paulo, looking for a job, I was in an uncomfortable situation, living in the house of relatives, sending curriculum to companies I didn’t know, I didn’t even know how to make a good curriculum.
I looked for groups of college students. I received a tip to adjust the curriculum, and indicating on openings in a company.
Then I obtained a position in one of the most relevant projects of the company, with double the salary of the previous company that I would enter. That is a good example of a huge difference one community made in my life. Start now to join communities of people who have the same goals as you.
You can start as follows: register at meetup.com and search
for meetings that occur in your city, create a Twitter account,
follow people who are a reference in the area that you work or want to work. Sign up for groups on Slack, Whatsapp, Telegram or others that are of your area of ​​interest. Follow people who are authorities in the area you want to be and also, people who are
starting or walking the same path as you.
Once you are following the communities in your area, you need to select a few that you will follow more closely, those that will inspire you more
directly. You will follow in his footsteps. Those are at the top of where you want to arrive. You will follow them closely and learn from them. You will know them so well, that will soon find an opportunity to speak with them online or in person.
A very important point, in order to reach the highest positions in your area, it is highly recommended that you have a mentor. When you have a high trust relationship, you may have a specialist in your area as your mentor. Many of these leaders are very engaged in improving people lives. Even if you pay for a mentoring, you will get as far as you ever imagined before.


== 6. Love the process

The principle of love the process is to be happy and enjoy every moment of your career. Let me tell you a small story to explain better. Suppose you are making a trip to a beautiful beach, and this trip lasts about 6 hours. Normally you will pass by paradisiacal paths, valleys, mountains, and birds. But sometimes, you are so obsessed with the end of the journey that you do not enjoy the amazing landscapes, sometimes even more beautiful than your final destination. Then you arrive at the beach and it’s raining, and you lost the opportunity to enjoy the amazing trip.
So, never forget to enjoy the path to your dream. Enjoy the process.
It is important that you learn these concepts because some achievements in our life have a long way to go. It makes no sense to be unhappy all this way.
Be happy now. The state of happiness, joy, sadness, stress among others, are reactions, which can be trained and taught to our brain.
You can train your brain to be happy, to produce the hormones of well-being, joy and happiness.
Remember that your brain filters out and discards the information you consider to be irrelevant.
Pass the message to your brain that your happiness is relevant.
Before bed and just after wake up, affirm with calm and confidence "This is a great, an amazing day, full of joy and happiness." Keep in mind the joy of good moments of your life, like the first day of employment. Feel the same energy and joy.
At various points in your day, try to bring joyful memories. Work singing softly or listening to music you love.
Make sure that most of the time of your day you are focused on happy moments. This is training. It will take time, but you will create a habit of being happy until happiness becomes a natural state your being. You will train your brain to produce hormones of happiness and joy.
This will bring you another even bigger gain. You will start to pass positive energy, people realize this and begin to approach you.
Even opportunities that never showed up begin to appear.
Happy thoughts attract happy events, that's how things work.
I have tried this many times in my life, so I want to encourage you to learn how to use these resources available to all who wish to use them.


== 7. Filter information.

There is an enormous abundance of information around us today. At the same time
that this is good, this also generates a very intense dispute by the audience on the part of the media.
Marketers use highly sophisticated techniques to grab the attention of the public and gain a high audience. These are techniques that cause certain hypnosis to whom it is exposed. Can you remember something you bought and soon after your regret? And you do not even know why you bought it? It is the techniques of
marketing, very effective at manipulating people – they are so-called "Mental Triggers".
It is important that you learn how to filter this information because, in today's world, persuasion techniques have become more advanced. They can produce true collective hypnosis - think a little about what the political disputes have caused in the population – professionals marketers work hard to dominate the masses. Don’t be dominated by media, social media and marketers.
Decrease the amount of time that is exposed to bad news.
Stop following people in the media who show themselves superior and try to convince you, that your country, your job, your company is a hell, that you are a miserable person, that your life sucks. Demand respect of yourself. Stop getting into useless discussions on social networks, stop following obnoxious people who spread revolt and ill-being in you. Use your time to build
a better future and career for you.
When you stop following these media and harmful people, you will gain more time to work on your own growth. Start following people who really bring
some growth information for you. Groups that are aligned with your goals. Get closer to people focused on pointing out solutions,
motivation and inspiration.  Be closer to those who are in your area of ​​actuation, those that are where you want to be, eventually residing in your state, region, those who will speak at some event close to you, etc.
In time, you will have created a positive network, a positive world around you, that will inspire you and point out real ways and solutions, that you could not see before.


== Final Considerations.


In the lessons above, I passed down the essence of the principles that took me out of a meaningless life and a hell job, to my dream career with lots of achievements and joys.
This does not mean not having to face problems, but rather confront them with tranquility, knowing that everything will be resolved soon.
When you begin to practice these teachings you will surely continue to find challenges, but you will be more focused on the solutions instead of problems. You will not stop, complaining and waiting for someone to solve them for you.
Another good thing is that I want to walk with you on this path of victories, accomplishments, and challenges. I want to go deeper into these concepts, sharing more content to help you use amazing techniques, I learned in my journey to my dream career.
